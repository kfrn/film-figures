## Planning and requirements

#### Basics

- 35mm: 16 frames to a foot
- 16mm: 40 frames to a foot

#### MVP

Given the gauge (16mm/35mm), set one of the following:
- length (metres or feet)
- duration (assuming a speed of 24fps)
- number of frames

And the results for the other two parameters will be calculated.

#### Further controls

- Other gauges:
   - **8mm**: 80 frames per foot
   - **Super-8**: 72 frames per foot (71.9887)
   - **9.5mm**: 40 frames per foot (Read & Meyer) - same pitch as 16mm
   - **28mm**: 20.5 frames per foot
   - **65mm**: 12.8 frames per foot/ 42 frames per metre
- Other speeds: 25fps, 30fps, 16fps, etc
