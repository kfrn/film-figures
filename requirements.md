## Planning and requirements

#### Basics

- 35mm: 16 frames to a foot
- 16mm: 40 frames to a foot

#### MVP

Given the gauge (16mm/35mm), set one of the following:
- length (metres or feet)
- duration (assuming a speed of 24fps)
- number of frames

And the results for the other two parameters will be calculated.

#### Further controls

- Other gauges: 8mm, 9.5mm, 65mm
- Other speeds: 25fps, 30fps, 16fps, etc
